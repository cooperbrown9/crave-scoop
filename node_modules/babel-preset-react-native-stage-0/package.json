  "readme": "# babel-preset-react-native-stage-0\n\nHave you encountered weird errors in React Native when trying to use `babel-preset-react-native` and `babel-preset-stage-0` together? Are you generally just confused and frustrating by how hard it is to use the latest and greatest Babel features on RN? This preset is for you!\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install babel-preset-react-native-stage-0 --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nJust add a `.babelrc` file to your React Native project that looks like this:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"react-native-stage-0\"]\n}\n```\n\nDo you want/need experimental legacy decorator support (provided by [babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy))? Use this as your .babelrc instead:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"react-native-stage-0/decorator-support\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Q**: I added `stage-0` to my \"presets\" list, and now everything is broken!\n\n**A**: Don't do that! This preset supersedes the need for including the stage-0 preset, and works properly with React Native.\n\n---\n\n**Q**: I changed my .babelrc to the above, but I'm still getting strange Babel errors!\n\n**A**: Have you cleared your packager cache? Run the following:\n\n```bash\nwatchman watch-del-all\n[the command you use to start the packager] --reset-cache\n```\n\nIf things are still broken, open an issue and I'll try to help you. I may say \"not a problem with this preset\", and make you go open an issue on the react-native repo. Don't be mad at me if I do that!\n",
