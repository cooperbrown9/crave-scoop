  "readme": "# Lottie for iOS, MacOS (and [Android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android) and [React Native](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-react-native))\n\nLottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as json with [bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) and renders the vector animations natively on mobile and through React Native!\n\nFor the first time, designers can create **and ship** beautiful animations without an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand.\nSince the animation is backed by JSON they are extremely small in size but can be large in complexity!\nAnimations can be played, resized, looped, sped up, slowed down, and even interactively scrubbed.\n\nLottie also supports native UIViewController Transitions out of the box!\n\nHere is just a small sampling of the power of Lottie\n\n![Example1](_Gifs/Examples1.gif)\n![Example2](_Gifs/Examples2.gif)\n\n<img src=\"_Gifs/Community 2_3.gif\" />\n\n![Example3](_Gifs/Examples3.gif)\n\n![Abcs](_Gifs/Examples4.gif)\n\n## Using Lottie\nLottie supports iOS 8 and above.\nLottie animations can be loaded from bundled JSON or from a URL\n\nTo bundle JSON just add it and any images that the animation requires to your target in xcode.\n\nThe simplest way to use it is with LOTAnimationView:\n```objective-c\nLOTAnimationView *animation = [LOTAnimationView animationNamed:@\"Lottie\"];\n[self.view addSubview:animation];\n[animation playWithCompletion:^(BOOL animationFinished) {\n  // Do Something\n}];\n```\n\nIf you are working with multiple bundles you can use.\n\n```objective-c\nLOTAnimationView *animation = [LOTAnimationView animationNamed:@\"Lottie\" inBundle:[NSBundle YOUR_BUNDLE]];\n[self.view addSubview:animation];\n[animation playWithCompletion:^(BOOL animationFinished) {\n  // Do Something\n}];\n```\n\nOr you can load it programmatically from a NSURL\n```objective-c\nLOTAnimationView *animation = [[LOTAnimationView alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL URLWithString:URL]];\n[self.view addSubview:animation];\n```\n\nLottie supports the iOS `UIViewContentModes` aspectFit, aspectFill and scaleFill\n\nYou can also set the animation progress interactively.\n```objective-c\nCGPoint translation = [gesture getTranslationInView:self.view];\nCGFloat progress = translation.y / self.view.bounds.size.height;\nanimationView.animationProgress = progress;\n```\n\nWant to mask arbitrary views to animation layers in a Lottie View?\nEasy-peasy as long as you know the name of the layer from After Effects\n\n```objective-c\nUIView *snapshot = [self.view snapshotViewAfterScreenUpdates:YES];\n[lottieAnimation addSubview:snapshot toLayerNamed:@\"AfterEffectsLayerName\"];\n```\n\nLottie comes with a `UIViewController` animation-controller for making custom viewController transitions!\n\n```objective-c\n#pragma mark -- View Controller Transitioning\n\n- (id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)animationControllerForPresentedController:(UIViewController *)presented\n                                                                  presentingController:(UIViewController *)presenting\n                                                                      sourceController:(UIViewController *)source {\n  LOTAnimationTransitionController *animationController = [[LOTAnimationTransitionController alloc] initWithAnimationNamed:@\"vcTransition1\"\n                                                                                                          fromLayerNamed:@\"outLayer\"\n                                                                                                            toLayerNamed:@\"inLayer\"];\n  return animationController;\n}\n\n- (id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)animationControllerForDismissedController:(UIViewController *)dismissed {\n  LOTAnimationTransitionController *animationController = [[LOTAnimationTransitionController alloc] initWithAnimationNamed:@\"vcTransition2\"\n                                                                                                          fromLayerNamed:@\"outLayer\"\n                                                                                                            toLayerNamed:@\"inLayer\"];\n  return animationController;\n}\n\n```\n\nIf your animation will be frequently reused, `LOTAnimationView` has an built in LRU Caching Strategy.\n\n## Swift Support\n\nLottie works just fine in Swift too!\nSimply `import Lottie` at the top of your swift class, and use Lottie as follows\n\n```swift\nlet animationView = LOTAnimationView(name: \"hamburger\")\nself.view.addSubview(animationView)\n\nanimationView.play(completion: { finished in\n    // Do Something\n})\n```\n## Note:\nAnimation file name should be first added to your project. as for the above code sample, It won't work until you add an animation file called `hamburger.json`.. \n`let animationView = LOTAnimatedView.animationNamed(\"here_goes_your_json_file_name_without_.json\")` \n\n## Supported After Effects Features\n\n### Keyframe Interpolation\n\n---\n\n* Linear Interpolation\n* Bezier

\"airbnb/lottie-ios\" \"master\"\n```\nrun\n```\ncarthage update\n```\n\n## Try it out\n\nLottie Uses Cocoapods!\nGet the Cocoapod or clone this repo and try out [the Example App](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios/tree/master/Example)\nAfter installing the cocoapod into your project import Lottie with\n`#import <Lottie/Lottie.h>`\n\nTry with Carthage.\nIn your application targets “General” tab under the “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” section, drag and drop lottie-ios.framework from the Carthage/Build/iOS directory that `carthage update` produced.\n\n## Community Contributions\n * [Xamarin bindings](https://github.com/martijn00/LottieXamarin)\n * [NativeScript bindings](https://github.com/bradmartin/nativescript-lottie)\n * [Appcelerator Titanium bindings](https://github.com/m1ga/ti.animation)\n * MacOS Support added by [Alex Pawlowski](https://github.com/pawlowskialex)\n\n## Alternatives\n1. Build animations by hand. Building animations by hand is a huge time commitment for design and engineering across Android and iOS. It's often hard or even impossible to justify spending so much time to get an animation right.\n2. [Facebook Keyframes](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Keyframes). Keyframes is a wonderful new library from Facebook that they built for reactions. However, Keyframes doesn't support some of Lottie's features such as masks, mattes, trim paths, dash patterns, and more.\n2. Gifs. Gifs are more than double the size of a bodymovin JSON and are rendered at a fixed size that can't be scaled up to match large and high density screens.\n3. Png sequences. Png sequences are even worse than gifs in that their file sizes are often 30-50x the size of the bodymovin json and also can't be scaled up.\n\n## Why is it called Lottie?\nLottie is named after a German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation. Her best known films are The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) – the oldest surviving feature-length animated film, preceding Walt Disney's feature-length Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) by over ten years\n[The art of Lotte Reineger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvU55CUw5Ck&feature=youtu.be)\n\n## Contributing\nContributors are more than welcome. Just upload a PR with a description of your changes.\n\nIf you would like to add more JSON files feel free to do so!\n\n## Issues or feature requests?\nFile github issues for anything that is unexpectedly broken. If an After Effects file is not working, please attach it to your issue. Debugging without the original file is much more difficult.\n\n## Roadmap (In no particular order)\n- Add support for interactive animated transitions\n- Add support for parenting programmatically added layers, moving/scaling\n- Programmatically alter animations\n- Animation Breakpoints/Seekpoints\n- Gradients\n- LOTAnimatedButton\n- Repeater objects\n\n",
